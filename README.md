# Purpose:
    The purpose of this tool is two parts; first to teach Michaelis-Menten Kinetics, and two to have an affordable means of identifying optical properties of a solution.  The tool cost #% which is lower than others on the market.  You can build it yourself for $xxx, or purchases your kit from [Cell Eleven - Polarimeter](https://www.celleleven.com/polarimeter).  

# Goal:
The goal is to recreate the Michaelis-Menten experiment using the current available technologies at the best possible price.

# Research
  Overview:  Light of a know concentration is polarized and passed through a sample.  Thelight interaction with the sample also rotates the polarized light.  Using known values of light traveled, temperatures, and the angle between the two polarized films, the optical rotation of the solution can be quantized.  This is one feature to help identify a solution.

# Formula
  [α]T/λ = (100 * α)/(l * c)
